# Osprey
<p style="width:1200px">Osprey is a Windows application tool intended for IT professionals to monitor groups of folders and the activity within them. You have many IT projects. You have many IT problems. If you are like me, you open and reopen File Explore countless time. You've been conditioned to sift through the heap of icons cluttering the taskbar for folders you've lost track of, buried under a myriad of application windows, <b>time-after-time</b>.  Osprey allows you to group your folders into one parent window like a purposeful team. You always know where they are. Assign your folders to a team of folders, save the folder paths, and launch these teams as needed. And, the folders are contained within a single parent window, tiled or cascaded, and in the precise order they were saved.
</p>
<p style="width:1200px">
How many times in a week do you launch File Explorer and search for the same group of folders? Instead, launch Osprey and build your folder teams. Browse to each folder and save as you go – one time. Reload each team as needed with one click. Your File Explorer windows are neatly organized in a single parent window, <b>time-after-time</b>. 
</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Reload each team with one mouse click. </li>
 <li>Move the entire team to a different screen.</li>
 <li>Resize the entire team.</li>
 <li>Minimize the team parent window.</li>
 <li>Launch multiple instances of Osprey and display several teams on different screens.</li>
</ul>
The folders stay in place. No more hunting for that one, lost folder buried in the pile of icons that clutter your taskbar. 

<br><br>
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b><br>
As an ETL developer or a production support engineer, I might monitor 4 folders for one ETL called, "The Topaz Data Files Load". 
<font >
<ol>
<li>Open Osprey.</li> 
<li>[File] -> [Add New Explorer].
            Browse to your first folder member.
            Repeat this for the 3 other folders.
</li>

<li>[Save As] -> Type "Topaz" in the textbox.
            Press [Enter] key. 
            <p>Team “Topaz” is created with its 4 members. The Topaz group is saved to 
            OspreyData.xml. The XML node is named "Topaz". It has 4 child nodes, each
            containing their respective folder path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
1.  Open Osprey. 
2.  [File] -> [Add New Explorer].
            Browse to your first folder member.
            Repeat this for the 3 other folders.

3.  [Save As] -> Type "Topaz" in the textbox.
            Press [Enter] key. 
            <p>Team “Topaz” is created with its 4 members. The Topaz group is saved to 
            OspreyData.xml. The XML node is named "Topaz". It has 4 child nodes, each
            containing their respective folder path.</p>

<b>ACTIONS:</b><br>      

<table width="1000px style="border:1px solid gray;" ><tr"> 
 <td Width="20%">[Save] or [Save As] </td>
 <td Width="80%">  Whenever you [Save] or [Save As], Osprey will act upon what is currently loaded
                   into the parent window. So, you can have Topaz loaded, modify paths, add
                   additional folders and when satisfied with adjustments, <br>
                   <p>click [Save As] -> "Diamond". Press [Enter] key. <br>
                   Now there are two collections of folders that can be 
                   reloaded. These are saved in the OperyData.xml file as two nodes.
                    </p>
</td></tr>
<tr> 
    <td Width="20%">[Open]</td>
    <td Width="80%"> 
        <p>When you click [Open], a ComboBox becomes visible and lists all saved folder 
        teams. You might have the two teams from above, "Topaz" and "Diamond". Select one 
        from the dropdown list to load its group of folders into the parent window.
     </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td Width="20%">[Rename]</td> 
    <td Width="80%"> 
     <p>
        Click [Rename] and a textbox becomes visible. Give Team “Topaz” a new name by 
        typing "Ruby" in the textbox. Press [Enter] and the OspreyData.xml “Topaz” node is
        renamed to “Ruby”.

        This was handy during development. I don't know how useful it is in    
        practice. But, someone just might want to "factory reset" their xml file. 
        Have at it.

    <td Width="80%"> 
     <p>
        I created this for IT Pros and purposefully omitted pop-up warnings and progress
        bars to make this a simple tool - like a hammer. Take precautionary measures to
        avoid deleting or resetting your OpseryData.xml file. Consider saving an extra copy 
       of your OspreyData.xml file.
     </p>

     <p>
        This is a very simple XML file and if you know a thing or two about XML, you should
        feel comfortable editing this file. Why, you ask? You can change the order of how your folders 
        load and display. You've probably experinced how XML parses backwards. Keep this in mind
        if you want to change the order of your folders because the folder paths will load into the parent 
        window from bottom to top. So, reorder the child nodes accordingly.

<H1><b>Welcome</b></H1>

Thank you for installing Osprey. I hope this tool will help you organize your folder views and make your job easier. 
<br/><br/>
This is a simple application with a handfull of features. To get a quick sense of the user interface, look at the topic, "Main Menu" which will have a few pictures.

<h2>What is Osprey?</h2>

 Collect your File Explorer windows into a single application window. Tile your folder windows. Move, resize, minimize, or maximize all your folder windows as a single application window. Osprey gives you the bird's eye view of your folders.
<br/><br/> 
If your job is like mine, you arrange your File Explore windows in a tiled view to monitor and work on several folders. But, periodically, you'll rearrange them as other application windows overtake your screens. Osprey binds your File Explorer windows into one application window so you need only to find that one icon in you cluttered taskbar. 
<ul>

<li>
<b>Drag-and-drop</b> your folder icons to Osprey's surface for a tiled view. Menu ->[View] -> [Tile] .  


<br/><br/>
<li>Save this layout to instantly recreate this folder group later. Launch Osprey, select your folder group from a drop-down list for your tiled layout.

<br/><br/>
<li>
Drag Opsrey to a different screen or minimize it or maximize it, the entire folder layout follows. 

<br/><br/>
<li>
Folder groups are save to  Osprey's XML data file(s). Create as many folder groups and  xml data files as you need. It can all be selected from the UI.
</ul>

<h2>Use Case</h2>
See Getting Started for step-by-step examples.
<br/><br/>
ETL Developer use case: 
<br/>
As an ETL Developer or Support Analyst, I have many ETL processes, each with their unique file movements and folder groups. Debugging and troubleshooting each process requires monitoring a distinct group of folders. I lose these folders as unrelated applications take over the screen. 
<ul>
<li> I want to collect my folders and pin them to a tiled layout so they behave like a single application window. </li>
<li> I want to easily call up a group of folders into tiled view. </li>
<li> I want the option to make my folder group the top visible window above other applications.</li>
<li> I want to easily switch to other folder groups to troubleshoot different ETL processes and task.
</ul>

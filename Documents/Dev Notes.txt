<Save As> is fixed.
<Rename> is fixed.
Form1.AcceptButton this button is in the upper left corner of the parent form and not visible. It is needed for when the user clicks the enter button. 
                   It is a safe way to register the <Enter> press and giving the action a path to do nothing. This is used on the child explorer windows 
				   when the user enters a path and clicks <Enter>.
<Save>
<Reset OspreyData.Xml> fixed.

Child MDI Labels. Users must manually update the XML [label] attribute. But, by doing so they can add a label to the top of each child window. Default is the uri.

<Save> functionality is working.            
A new menu ComboBox is loaded on Form_Load by the function util_PopulateComboFromXML(). 
util_PopulateComboFromXML() reads the OspryData.xml. For each "Instance" Node 
reads the attribute named "Label" and fills the comboBox. No functionality beyond that.

Naming convention:
  Menu event handlers start with "Menu_" and are group alphabetically.
  Helper functions start with "util_" and are grouped at the bottom.

util_ResetOspreyDataXml. will recreate an empty OsperyData.xml file.


ISSUES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar tasks for creating and parsing the XmlDocument occurs in several methods.
This should be consolidated with the XmlDoc at the instance level. private scope.

util_SaveInstancePaths:			When saving the Instance data, the attribute "Label" needs a value. Currently, System.DateTime.Now 
								is fullfilling this, but, obviously that is not a useful Instance label.


Child form resizing :			This has been implemented, but, it seems sluggish to refresh. This only seems to be the case with
								the more complicated multi-Instance version. The simple version does not seem sluggish. 
								System.DateTime.Now is fullfilling the Instance Label value. Combobox is populated upon loading

Open empty Instance:			Anytime an Instance node is empty, the user should be notified otherwise this would cause 
								confusion because the user might not understand why they selected an instance to load,
								but, no explorer windows rendered.

Saving current session urls:
* Don't enable the Save menuitems on Form_Load() because there is nothing to "save" at this point.
* The user must either     1. Initiate a new child file explorer (now there is something to save) 
*                          2. Select an instance to load the child explorer windows. (now there is something to save)        
     
 3 <Save> scenarios:
				1.	Save. User's first-time save. No previous saves. 
					Dev note:	First check the OspreyData.xml for Instance nodes. 
			 					1a.	IF		count is 0, then build the node, insert the childnode, and save.
             					1b.	ELSE	Overwrite. this could be a correction by the use to the child explorer list. 
			 								remove the current nodes and replace with current session child explorer list.
 			 
				2.	Save As:
					Dev Note:	User to create a new node. This could be a copy of the current or it could be one that changed durring the session.
               
				3.  Rename:
					Dev Notes:	User wants a differnt name for the current session instance. Keep the child explorer nodes untouched.

<h2>What is Osprey?</h2>
Osprey gives you a bird's eye view of all your folders in a single parent window. Cascaded your folders or tile them. Drag the entire layout like a single window. <br/>
Resize, minimize, and maximize as needed. Organize windows one time and save. No need to search your cluttered taskbar.
<br/><br/> 
If your job is like mine, you arrange your File Explore windows in a tiled layout to monitor and work on several folders. Throughout the day you'll search for and reposition <br/>
them as other application windows overtake your screens.  Osprey pins your File Explorer windows into one application window so you only need to click <br/>
Osprey among the myriad of taskbar of icons. 
<ul>

<li>
<b>Drag-and-drop</b> your folder icons to Osprey's surface for a tiled view. [Menu] ->[View] -> [Tile] .  


<br/>
<li>Save the layout to instantly activate the layout from a drop down selection. 

<br/>
<li>
Drag Osprey to a different screen or minimize it or maximize it, the entire folder layout follows. 

<br/>
<li>
Folder groups are save to  Osprey's XML data file(s). Create as many folder groups and  xml data files as you need. It can all be selected from the UI.
</ul>

<h2>Use Case</h2>
See Getting Started in the "Osprey Help.chm" file for step-by-step examples.
<br/><br/>
ETL Developer use case: 
<br/>
As an ETL Developer or Support Analyst, I have many ETL processes, each with their unique file movements and folder groups. Debugging and troubleshooting each process <br/>
	requires monitoring a distinct group of folders. I lose these folders as unrelated applications take over the screen. 
<ul>
<li> I want to collect my folders and pin them to a tiled layout so they behave like a single application window. </li>
<li> I want to easily call up a group of folders into tiled view. </li>
<li> I want to quickly and easily switch to other folder groups to troubleshoot different ETL processes and task.
<li> I want the option to make window the top visible application above others so my folders are never obscured.</li>
</ul>

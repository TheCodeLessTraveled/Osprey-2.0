# Osprey-2.0 ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/TheCodeLessTraveled/Osprey-2.0/total?color=green)

Osprey gives you a bird's eye view of all your folders in a single parent window. Create a tiled layout of your folder collection. Resize, minimize, and maximize as needed. Drag the entire layout to another screen. Organize windows one time and save. Create and save as many folder groups as needed and recall each group as needed. Osprey pins your File Explorer windows into one application window so you don't need to search the myriad of icons that clutter your taskbar.

<h2>Use Case</h2>
See Getting Started in the "Osprey Help.chm" file for step-by-step examples.
<br/><br/>
ETL Developer use case: 
<br/>
As an ETL Developer or Support Analyst, I have many ETL processes, each with their unique file movements and folder groups. Debugging and troubleshooting each process <br/>
	requires monitoring a distinct group of folders. I lose these folders as unrelated applications take over the screen. 
<ul>
<li> I want to collect my folders and pin them to a tiled layout so they behave like a single application window. </li>
<li> I want to easily call up a group of folders into tiled view. </li>
<li> I want to quickly and easily switch to other folder groups to troubleshoot different ETL processes and task.
<li> I want the option to make window the top visible application above others so my folders are never obscured.</li>
</ul>
